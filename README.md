A Java re-make of an Atari 2600 game. It's very similar to settlers of catan.

To build this, you'll need the Gears Engine, found here on my GitHub. More information about it can be found there.

This was a project built for the CS 2340 class, we had a team of 5 to put together a game in about 13 weeks. This was the first time I had ever really worked in a group. This is the exact state the gamew as in when we presented it to the class and turned it in for a grade. We had several communication problems and leadership issues where we didn't identify each other's strengths and weaknesses, so we had large portions of the project go unfinished while we sprinted around attempting to put out fires. Still, I'm proud enough of the tech behind it.
